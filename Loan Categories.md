<table>
  <tr>
    <td>PAD</td>
    <td>- Created when the bank pays the exporter under an L/C and holds the shipping documents.<br> 
      - Importer cannot take delivery until PAD is settled.</td>
    <td>usually 21–30 days</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LTR</td>
    <td>Created if the importer wants to take delivery of goods but cannot pay PAD immediately:<br>
      - Bank releases documents against a Trust Receipt signed by the importer.<br>
      - Importer promises to pay after selling goods.</td>
    <td>usually 180 days</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LIM</td>
    <td>Created if the importer defaults or fails to clear PAD/LTR<br>
      - Bank clears goods from port and stores them in its own warehouse. (Bank takes physical control of goods as collateral.)<br>
      - Creates LIM account to recover dues by selling goods under Bank supervision</td>
    <td>360 days Max</td>
  </tr>
</table>
